## Description (Requirements facing)
A stock ticker is a report of the price for certain securities, updated continuously throughout the trading session by the various stock exchanges.

### Components enumeration
Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Event Hub, Azure API App, Azure Functions, Azure Web PubSub, and Azure Web Apps.


### Stateful vs Stateless
Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Event Hub are stateful services, meaning they maintain a record of the state of the data that they store or process over time.

Azure Cosmos DB is a NoSQL database service that allows for multiple data models to be used and provides features such as global distribution, automatic indexing, and multiple consistency levels. It stores and manages data in a structured format and allows for data retrieval using various query methods.

Azure Event Hub is a streaming platform designed to handle large amounts of data, such as real-time event streams from IoT devices. It provides features such as partitioning, event ordering, and durable storage, allowing it to maintain the state of the data it processes over time.

On the other hand, Azure API App, Azure Functions, Azure Web PubSub, and Azure Web Apps are all stateless services, meaning they do not maintain any state of the data they process. They execute code in response to events or requests but do not store or manage data over time.

### Functions as a Service (FaaS)
Functions as a Service (FaaS), such as Azure Functions, are stateless by default, but they can also be designed to be stateful depending on the use case.

For example, a FaaS application can be designed to store state externally in a database or other storage service. This allows the function to access and update the state as needed, allowing it to maintain state across function invocations.

However, it's generally recommended to design FaaS applications as stateless to take advantage of the scalability benefits of serverless computing. By keeping the functions stateless, the provider can easily spin up new instances of the function to handle increased load without worrying about managing state across multiple instances.

### Websockets
Azure Web PubSub is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft Azure that enables real-time messaging scenarios. WebSockets are one of the primary protocols used by Azure Web PubSub to provide real-time bi-directional communication between clients and the server.

When a client connects to Azure Web PubSub using WebSockets, a persistent connection is established between the client and the server. This connection remains open for the duration of the client's session, allowing the server to push messages to the client in real-time.

Azure Web PubSub supports both JSON and MessagePack encoding for WebSocket messages. JSON encoding is the default and is used when the message is small or when interoperability with other WebSocket clients is necessary. MessagePack encoding is a more compact binary format that can be used when bandwidth efficiency is a concern or when dealing with large volumes of data.

Azure Web PubSub also provides features such as authentication and authorization, message broadcasting, and message filtering, which can be used in conjunction with WebSockets to create a variety of real-time messaging scenarios.

## System description
The system gets data about stocks (ticks) while sending them to the users and also storing them.

### Data Sources
The Azure Function generates dummy data that is sent to Event Hub.
The client can also add data through the client app using the API.

### Event Processor
The Azure function gets triggered by new events from the Event Hub.
It processes them adding them to the database and publishing them to Web PubSub.

### Websockets / Broadcasting to users in real time
The Web PubSub service broadcasts the data received from Azure Function to
all its subscribers via websockets in real time.

### Get/Post data
Via the API you can either query all the data available or add new entries via client app.

### CI/CD
All the code written here is deployed via Github Actions to the Azure Services.

### Stack
Everything is written in .NET with several snippets of Javascript (requests, websockets, real-time table rows addition).
